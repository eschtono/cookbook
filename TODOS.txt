Lots of characters within <> were lost in translation...

Fixed the Germanic numbering again -- why is this?

679.477.248 -> 679,477,248

You took the most up-to-date version from Gdocs, oder?

Need to update all the Unicode versions, etc.

Fixed a large part of the editing for `', ``'', 

References to numbered examples
multiple-sequence of characters in 3

reinsertion of a lot of the glyphs, etc.

all glyphs need to be checked
all <>s need to be checked and/or readded

nope, the ‘originaltext.tex’ should be ignored from now on.

great work already btw!

about spelling: I think we should go for american english, and I expect you agree :-)
about quotation: I think most of our quoted texts strings should be single quoted.

oh no, I just read the manual :-) http://langsci-press.org/public/downloads/lsp-guidelines.pdf

Double quotation marks are generally used for distancing, in particular in the following situations:

1. when a passage from another work is cited in the text (e.g. According to Takahashi (2009: 33), “quotatives were never used in subordinate clauses in Old Japanese”); but block quotations do not have quotation marks;
2. when a technical term is mentioned that the author does not want to adopt, but wants to mention, e.g. This is sometimes called “pseudo-conservatism”, but I will not use this term here, as it could lead to confusion.

Single quotation marks are used exclusively for linguistic meanings, as in the following: Latin habere ‘have’ is not cognate with Old English hafian ‘have’.

so, we should normally use double quotation in most of our cases :-). In general though, I would like us to try and remove double quotations as much as possible. Mostly is thus signals uncertainty on our part :-).
