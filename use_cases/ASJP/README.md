# ASJP use-case

The ASJP-data are available online at http://asjp.clld.org (Wichmann, Brown & Holman, 2014). The original downloaded data is available verbatim in "/sources/".

The downloaded data comes in separate files, so I combined everything into one large csv file by using:
  $$$ awk 'FNR>1' sources/*.csv > data/ASJ
and then manually added a new header line. When you have csvkit installed, it can be done cleaner by:
  $$$ csvstack sources/*.csv > data/ASJP.csv
